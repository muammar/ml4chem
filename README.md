This package is written in Python 3, and intends to offer modern and rich
features to perform machine learning workflows for chemical physics.

A list of features and methods are shown below.

- PyTorch backend.
- Completely modular. You can use any part of this package in your project.
- Free software <3. No secrets! Pull requests and additions are more than
  welcome!
- Documentation (work in progress).
- Explicit and idiomatic: `ml4chem.get_me_a_coffee()`.
- Distributed training in a data parallelism paradigm (mini-batches).
- Scalability and distributed computations are powered by Dask.
- Real-time tools to track status of your computations.
- [Messagepack serialization](https://msgpack.org/index.html).
